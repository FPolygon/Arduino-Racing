# Arduino-Racing
This code has 2 buttons and an 2x16 LCD. It will initialize the LCD with greetings to layer 1 and 2. 
   On a button push, each player will get their respective lines on the screen and every button press and release will 
   increment a symbol to be added to each respective line. When a line is filled, that line is cleared and the player goes to round 2
   and repeats filling the line. When round 2 is completed, that line will terminate with the special winning character and after
   a delay, return to the title screen.
